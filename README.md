Just a repo with my dotfiles and their backups.
## Not intended for installation for now. Just used as a backup

## Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ files               # Folder with all the current files. They are included as if they were in ~/
â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh          # Ignore this file. It used to install all the complementary tools for me, NOT the dotfiles.
â”œâ”€â”€ oldfiles.tar.gz     # Contains dotfiles from a previous distro (Arcolinuxd XFCE)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ TGZ                 # Folder with 5 dotfiles backups compressed as .tar.gz
